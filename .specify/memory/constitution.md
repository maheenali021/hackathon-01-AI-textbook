# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Educational Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Content-First Development
All features must prioritize educational content quality and clarity above technical implementation; Content must be accurate, well-structured, and pedagogically sound; Every feature should enhance the learning experience for students studying Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

### Docusaurus-Centric Architecture
All book content must follow Docusaurus standards and conventions; Use MDX format for interactive content; Leverage Docusaurus's built-in features for navigation, search, and responsive design; Maintain compatibility with Docusaurus plugin ecosystem.

### Modular Content Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Content must be organized in modular, self-contained sections following the course outline; Each chapter and section should be independently readable while maintaining coherence with the overall curriculum; Clear dependencies and prerequisites must be documented for each module.

### Interactive Learning Experience
All code examples and simulations must be interactive where possible; Provide runnable code snippets, embedded simulators, and practical exercises; Ensure all interactive elements work across devices and platforms; Focus on hands-on learning experiences that reinforce theoretical concepts.

### Mobile-Responsive Design
All content and interactive elements must be fully responsive on mobile devices; Follow mobile-first design principles; Ensure accessibility standards are met for all users; Optimize for various screen sizes and input methods.

### Clean Separation of Concerns
Frontend content presentation is strictly separated from future backend features; No backend logic, authentication, or RAG chatbot implementation in this phase; All content must be static and self-contained within the Docusaurus structure; Future features will be added in subsequent phases without affecting current content.

## Technical Requirements
All code examples must be in languages relevant to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics (Python, C++, ROS 2); Include appropriate simulation environments (Isaac Sim, Webots, etc.); Follow best practices for educational code clarity; Ensure all examples are tested and functional; Include appropriate visualizations and diagrams to aid understanding.

## Development Workflow
All content must follow the Spec-Kit Plus methodology with clear specs, plans, and tasks; Use Claude Code for all development tasks; Create MDX pages following Docusaurus structure inside /frontend; Adhere to the weekly breakdown and module requirements provided in course outline; Maintain version control with clear commit messages.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational book project; All code changes must comply with these principles; Amendments require explicit documentation of changes and approval from project stakeholders; Each phase must be completed before moving to the next as outlined in the project requirements.
