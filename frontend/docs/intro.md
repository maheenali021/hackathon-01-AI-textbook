# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed for students, developers, and hobbyists interested in embodied AI and humanoid robots.

## About This Book

This educational resource covers the essential concepts of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics through four core modules:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Middleware for robot control
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Physics simulation and environment building
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Advanced perception and training
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

Each module includes hands-on exercises, milestone projects, and interactive content to help you understand these complex concepts.

## Target Audience

- Students building the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics capstone project
- Beginners to intermediate learners in ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA robotics
- Developers and hobbyists interested in embodied AI and humanoid robots

## How to Use This Book

This book is structured to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical applications. Each module builds upon the previous one, but can also be studied independently. We recommend following the modules in order for the best learning experience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this book, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of Physical AI and embodied systems
- Know how to work with ROS 2 for robot control
- Be familiar with simulation environments like Gazebo
- Understand NVIDIA Isaac for perception and navigation
- Know how to integrate vision, language, and action systems
